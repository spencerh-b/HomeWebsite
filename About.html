            <p>
                Welcome all,
                <br><br>
                I am a senior Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering student at Washington State University. I currently work as an undergraduate researcher and as a teaching assistant for the Computer Science School. I love robotics and embedded system and spend much of my free time working on projects related to these fields, but if other opportunities arise, I do not limit my projects to these fields. I hope to work for a company that inspires forward thinking and innovation, while positively influencing the future. Any opportunities for work are great opportunities in my eyes, and while it is difficult to express my desire to succeed, being driven is a characteristic that I believe, allows me to benefit any company.
                <br><br>
                My time spent away from engineering is primarily spent skiing, biking, or hiking. I as well enjoy traveling around the world or visiting family in far away places. While I am only able to speak two languages, I do love the challenge of learning about, and communicating with, people of different cultures, even if hand signals and laughter are the only mode of conversation.
                <br><br>
                It is difficult to describe oneself through words, especially in two paragraphs; so for any questions about my work please feel free to contact me.
                <br><br>
                Sincerely,
                <br><br>
                Spencer Barclay
            </p>
